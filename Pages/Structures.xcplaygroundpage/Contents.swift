 ### Structured Gym Regimen
 
 Exercise:
 
 We‚Äôll first create a structure for our exercises. We‚Äôll use this structure to keep track of:

 its name.
 what muscle groups it targets.
 how many repetitions (reps) we should do in one go.
 how many rounds of repetitions we should do (sets).
 How many total reps we‚Äôll be doing.
 Another structure we‚Äôll need to keep track of all these exercises is for our regimen! This structure will:

 track the day of the week.
 store the exercises we should do for a given day.
 include a method to remind us of a given day‚Äôs workout regimen.
 Are you ready to work this out? üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
