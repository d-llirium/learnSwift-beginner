 ### Rock, Paper, Scissors
 
 Exercise:
 
 Rock, paper, scissors is a classic two player hand game dating back to ancient China.

 Here are its universal rules:

 Rock destroys scissors
 Scissors cut paper
 Paper covers rock
 Keeping these guidelines in mind, weâ€™ll create a rock, paper, scissors program but with a modern twist - one of the players is a computer! ðŸ’»
